# Qubetics – Community Technical Improvement Pack

This repository contains community-proposed improvements for Qubetics:

- RFCs (architecture, security, bridge, risk layer, privacy)
- Production-grade process (CI, lint, security scanning)
- On-chain vesting module skeleton (`x/tics`) with invariants
- Ops scripts (systemd, Ansible), templates, and issue/PR templates

> Goal: raise reliability, security, privacy, and cross-chain bridge quality to industry standards without disrupting mainnet – phased, governance-driven upgrades.

## Added in pack v2

- `x/bridge` skeleton (interfaces, events, keeper)
- Threat model (STRIDE) template
- Grafana dashboards (bridge/validator)
- Extra security CI
- STRIDE checklist
