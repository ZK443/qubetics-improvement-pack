# RFC-001: Bridge and Security Enhancement for Qubetics Network

**Status:** Draft
**Author:** Independent Technical Auditor
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-09

## 1. Overview

This RFC proposes a modular, trust-minimized bridge architecture connecting **Ethereum**, **Solana**, and **Bitcoin** networks with the **Qubetics blockchain**, along with a unified security and governance framework.
The goal is to strengthen interoperability, ensure verifiable cross-chain transfers, and improve investor confidence through transparent CI/CD and security policies.

## 2. Current State Analysis

Based on public repositories:

- **Qubetics** maintains several infrastructure-oriented repos (`mainnet-upgrade`, `mainnetnode-script`, `testnet-script`) and the core `qubetics-blockchain` built on **Cosmos SDK**.
- The **bridge layer** and **security automation** are **not yet public** or incomplete.
- There is **no visible CI pipeline**, **no CODEOWNERS**, and **limited threat-model documentation**.
- Developer and investor trust could increase significantly by implementing a transparent modular system with consistent auditing.

## 3. Proposed Bridge Architecture

### 3.1. High-Level Design

**Multi-chain bridge topology:**

```text
Ethereum  ⇄  Qubetics  ⇄  Solana
       \            |
        \           ⇄  Bitcoin
         \
          ⇄  Off-chain verifier layer

```

- **Ethereum Bridge** — uses light client + zk-SNARK proof verification for ERC-20 and ERC-721 transfers.
- **Solana Bridge** — uses Solana light client and Merkle proofs verified via Qubetics smart module.
- **Bitcoin Bridge** — employs SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) or tBTC-style HTLC mechanism.
- **Off-chain Verifier Layer** — decentralized relayers submitting verified proofs across networks.

All bridges communicate through the **`x/bridge` module** in Qubetics.

### 3.2. Bridge Workflow

**Phases:**

1. **Send:**
   - User submits a transfer or cross-chain call.
   - Message gets hashed (`msg.ID`) and stored on Qubetics.
2. **Verify:**
   - A proof (zk/light/SPV) is generated on source chain.
   - Relayers submit proof to Qubetics verifier contracts.
   - Proof validation is modular: `lightClient.Verify()` or `zkClient.Verify()`.
3. **Execute:**
   - Once verified, message is executed (token mint, contract call, or unlock).
   - Replay protection via `msg.Nonce` and event logging.

**Invariants:**

- No `Execute` without a successful `Verify`.
- One-time execution per `(ID, Nonce)`.
- Multi-client verification: at least 2 proofs for high-value transactions.

### 3.3. Security and Risk Layer

A **Risk Layer** is introduced to protect users and investors:

- **Rate limits per route** (e.g., max daily transfer per token).
- **Circuit breakers** (automatic pause when anomalies detected).
- **Governance veto** (multi-sig or DAO-controlled stop).
- **Timelock upgrades** (prevent instant governance attacks).

**Audit hooks:**
Each bridge event emits standardized logs (`EventSend`, `EventVerify`, `EventExecute`) for external monitoring.

### 3.4. Compliance and Privacy

- **Data privacy:** minimal exposure of transaction metadata.
- **No personal identifiers** stored on-chain.
- **Optional dVPN layer** (Qubetics DVPN node integration) for private relayers.

## 4. CI/CD and Security Enhancements

To align with best practices from **Cosmos**, **Osmosis**, and **Celestia**, Qubetics should implement:

| Component | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **CI Workflows** | GitHub Actions: build, lint, test, gosec, SBOM |
| **Security Scanning** | `gosec ./...`, `syft packages . -o spdx-json` |
| **CodeQL Analysis** | GitHub native CodeQL for Go/Rust |
| **CODEOWNERS** | Required for clear code review ownership |
| **SECURITY.md** | Defines vulnerability disclosure policy |
| **CONTRIBUTING.md** | Developer guidelines and review standards |
| **Reproducible Builds** | Use cosign + SBOM for verifiable binaries |

## 5. Expected Outcomes

| Benefit | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Transparency** | Public, verifiable process builds investor confidence |
| **Security** | Automated audits and proof validation reduce risk |
| **Scalability** | Modular bridge design supports future chains |
| **Interoperability** | ETH–SOL–BTC cross-chain flow enables new liquidity |
| **Community Growth** | Clear processes attract open-source contributors |

## 6. Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|-------|-------------|
| Proof submission attacks | Multi-client verification, slashing relayers |
| Bridge exploit / replay | Nonce replay protection and event logs |
| Governance abuse | Timelock + veto mechanism |
| Network congestion | Rate limits and parallel proof queues |
| Compatibility drift | CI validation on every merge |

## 7. Implementation Plan

| Phase | Scope | Output |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **A** | Draft `x/bridge` and `x/tics` modules | Skeleton Go modules |
| **B** | Add Risk Layer, CI workflows, CODEOWNERS | Security structure |
| **C** | Integrate zk/light/SPV verification | Full bridge prototype |
| **D** | Deploy governance + on-chain monitoring | Production-ready bridge |

## 9. Summary

This RFC defines a secure, modular bridge architecture and governance system to transform Qubetics into a **production-grade, investor-trusted, multi-chain network**.
The implementation enhances transparency, interoperability, and long-term network resilience without breaking existing compatibility.
